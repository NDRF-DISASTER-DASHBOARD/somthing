The arrest was made in connection with the allegations of financial irregularities during his tenure, which are being investigated by the central agency alongside the rape-murder case. Three others have been arrested along with Sandip Ghosh. Sources said they are vendors Biplav Singha and Suman Hazara, who supplied medicine to the hospital and Afsar Ali, a security guard. As Principal of the RG Kar Medical College, where the woman doctor's body was discovered on the morning of August 9, the role of Sandip Ghosh has been questioned by many. Even the Supreme Court had questioned why he, the head of the institution, had not lodged a First Information Report immediately.\u00a0",

      "snippet": "Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder Live Updates: Health services remained crippled at state-run hospitals in West Bengal as junior doctors Wednesday continued to protest against the alleged rape and murder of a trainee medic at RG Kar hospital lats month, news agency PTI reported. The protesters have alleged inadequate steps by the police during its probe into the matter, before the investigation was handed over to the CBI by the Calcutta High Court. They are also demanding the Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal to resign. A day earlier, the West Bengal Assembly unanimously passed the newly drafted anti-rape Bill, that seeks capital punishment for a rape convict if the assault results in the death of a victim or leaves her in a vegetative state, and life sentence without parole for any other offender. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described the proposed legislation as \u201chistoric\u201d and rejected the Opposition charge that her government had not done enough for the security of women. Reacting to the passage of the Bill, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju took to X (formerly Twitter) to assert that while strong laws are necessary, strong actions are more important. \u201cThis is an extremely serious matter. Please don\u2019t make it political issue. Very strong laws are necessary but strong actions are more important. When the letter was written, media had carried this news extensively, but West Bengal Govt failed to act!\u201d Rijiju said.",
